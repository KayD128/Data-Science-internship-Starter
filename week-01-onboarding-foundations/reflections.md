# Week 1: Reflection Exercise

## Instructions
Answer the following questions thoughtfully. These reflections help you ground your learning and track your progress. There are no "right" answers - be honest and introspective!

## Self-Assessment Questions

### 1. Background & Experience
**What programming experience (if any) do you have?**
```
[I have programming experience with python. I strted with python basics and moved to using django and flask for website. Then, I started working with numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc for analysis. Scikit-learn library for predictive modelling. I have worked on personal projects since then, all on my GitHub but failed to deploy any online.]
```

**Have you worked with data before? If so, in what context?**
```
[I have worked with data for different reasons. Example is the weather report data. I used the features to predict of there would be rainfall or not. The features include; max temp., min temp, pressure, humidity, etc. I have also used data to analyse and bring out information for decision making. Like a Taxi company data. It contains the riders information, drivers information, payments made and also rides taken.]

### 2. Motivation & Goals
**Why did you choose to pursue a Data Science internship?**
```
[Based on my experience so far in the Data Science field, I feel I can still do more to improve, to get better in my area of interest.]
```

**What do you hope to achieve by the end of this 8-week program?**
```
[I hope to gain new knowledge in this program and have more and new projects for my portfolio]
```

**What area of data science interests you most? (e.g., Machine Learning, Analytics, NLP, Computer Vision)**
```
[Machine Learning]
```

### 3. Understanding the Basics
**In your own words, what is Data Science?**
```
[Data Science is the process of solving complex problem by a structured approach using data solving methods. In data science, models are created to predict the outcome of future events. It is a way of answering the question of "What will happen?", using mathematical and statistical approaches.]
```

**Name 3 real-world applications of Data Science:**
1. Natural Language Processing - To detect between violant or peaceful message
2. Medical field - Predict the diagnose of a disease or sickness
3. Engineering - Used in robotics and AI

---

### 4. Learning Style & Challenges
**How do you learn best? (e.g., visual tutorials, hands-on practice, reading documentation, pair programming)**
```
[I learn better with hands-on practice and pair programming]
```

**What are you most nervous or uncertain about?**
```
[Not understanding the advanced part of Data Science]
```

**How will you overcome this challenge?**
```
[I plan to take this more seriously and dedicate time to work. Time is what I need]
```

### 5. Weekly Reflection
**What was the most useful thing you learned this week?**
```
[Seeing that there are better ways to deploy project]
```

**What took longer than expected?**
```
[Nothing yet]
```

**What tool or concept would you like to understand better?**
```
[Model Selection and Model Deployment]
```

## Action Items for Next Week
Based on your reflections above, list 3 things you want to focus on or improve:

1. I need to revise my basic python programming skills. It's been too long
2. I want to understand how to use Scikit-learn better and do data exploration before model selection.
3. I also need to understand model deployment

**Remember:** This is your personal growth document. Be honest, reflect regularly, and update it as you progress through the internship!
